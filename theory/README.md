VIRTUAL DOM, FIBER & RECONCILIATION

1. Virtual DOM:

- Virtual DOM ia a copy of real DOM that React uses to update the UI efficiently.
- React compares the old DOM and new virtual DOM and updates only the necessary parts instead of re-rendering the whole DOM.
- This makes React applications faster and more efficient.
